# Lab README
Welcome to your first lab. This first exercise is designed to teach you the basic workflow of updating lab content, running tests, and submitting your coding activities. Note that all coding activities (coding labs, coding challenges, projects), will use a similar workflow of maniuplating code files, testing the code, committing.

## Java code
If you look within the src/main/java folder, you will find two Java classes, Vehicle.java and Questions.java. The 'Questions.java' file contains code comments with instructions.

## Test cases
If you look within the src/test/java folder, you will find the Java class 'QuestionsTest.java'. The 'src/test/java' folder will contain your test files.

### There is no need to change anything in this lab. The lab following this one should be rather simple, it will just involve modifying a bit of text in a method.
